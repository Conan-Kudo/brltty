Braille Support for Dracut
==========================

This module implements braille accessibility within the initramfs (initial
ramdisk file system). If BRLTTY is installed (``/usr/bin/brltty`` exists) then
it is added to the image. The braille drivers, text tables, attributes tables,
contraction tables, keyboard tables, speech drivers, and preferences file
configured via ``/etc/brltty.conf`` are included. Local customizations within
``/etc/xdg/brltty/`` are also included.

BRLTTY is started as early as possible by the initramfs so that braille
accessibility will be active when (should the need arise) control is
transferred to the emergency shell due to a problem preparing the root file
system. Additionally, braille accessibility is active at any of the specifiable
initramfs breakpoints (see the ``rd.break`` kernel parameter) except for the
one named ``cmdline`` because it occurs earlier than the point at which BRLTTY
is started.

Environment Variables
---------------------

A number of environment variables may be used to influence how BRLTTY is
installed into the initramfs image. Their names all begin with the
``BRLTTY_DRACUT_`` prefix. In addition to exporting them from the current
environment, they may be defined within the file ``/etc/brltty/dracut.conf``.
Within this file:

* Blank lines are ignored.
* Lines that start with a hash [``#``] are comments.
* All other lines should be simple shell-style assignments. For example::

    NAME="string"

The following environment variables are supported:

BRLTTY_DRACUT_LOCALE
  The preferred locale (used to determine the default text and contraction
  tables). For example::

    BRLTTY_DRACUT_LOCALE=cs_CZ.UTF-8

  If needed, i.e. if the text and contraction tables haven't both been
  configured via ``/etc/brltty.conf``, this information must be explicitly set
  because it can't be determined from the system configuration when building
  the image (see `<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1584036>`_).

BRLTTY_DRACUT_BRAILLE_DRIVERS
  A space-separated list of additional braille drivers to include. For
  example::

    BRLTTY_DRACUT_BRAILLE_DRIVERS="pm eu"

BRLTTY_DRACUT_BLUETOOTH_SUPPORT
  Whether or not Bluetooth support should be included within the initramfs. For
  example::

    BRLTTY_DRACUT_BLUETOOTH_SUPPORT=no

  Set this variable to ``yes`` if communication with your braille device is via
  Bluetooth. Note that this option is insecure because the link keys for all of
  your paired Bluetooth devices will be stored within the initramfs image.

BRLTTY_DRACUT_TEXT_TABLES
  A space-separated list of additional text tables to include. For example::

    BRLTTY_DRACUT_TEXT_TABLES="de fr"

BRLTTY_DRACUT_ATTRIBUTES_TABLES
  A space-separated list of additional attributes tables to include. For
  example::

    BRLTTY_DRACUT_ATTRIBUTES_TABLES="upper_lower left_right"

BRLTTY_DRACUT_CONTRACTION_TABLES
  A space-separated list of additional contraction tables to include. For
  example::

    BRLTTY_DRACUT_CONTRACTION_TABLES="de-kurzschrift fr-abrege"

BRLTTY_DRACUT_KEYBOARD_TABLES
  A space-separated list of additional keyboard tables to include. For
  example::

    BRLTTY_DRACUT_KEYBOARD_TABLES="keypad desktop"

BRLTTY_DRACUT_SPEECH_DRIVERS
  A space-separated list of additional speech drivers to include. For example::

    BRLTTY_DRACUT_SPEECH_DRIVERS="es fl"

Kernel Command Line Parameters
------------------------------

Disabling BRLTTY
````````````````

Given that BRLTTY is a rather complex application, a number of kernel command
line parameters have been introduced so that its various components can be
selectively disabled. In all cases, if any of these parameters isn't specified
then it defaults to ``1`` (enabled). They are:

  =========================  =========================================
  Kernel Parameter           Effect
  -------------------------  -----------------------------------------
  ``rd.brltty=0``            Completely disable BRLTTY.
  ``rd.brltty.bluetooth=0``  Disable Bluetooth support.
  ``rd.brltty.sound=0``      Disable speech drivers and sound support.
  ``rd.brltty.pulse=0``      Disable Pulse Audio support.
  =========================  =========================================

Specifying BRLTTY options
`````````````````````````

This module interprets kernel command line parameters that begin with the
``rd.brltty.`` prefix. All of BRLTTY's options that can be specified via
environment variables are supported (see ``man brltty`` for the full list). For
example, the kernel parameter ``rd.brltty.braille_driver=vo`` is mapped to the
environment variable assignment ``BRLTTY_BRAILLE_DRIVER=vo``. Some of the more
interesting ones are:

  ================================  ===============================
  Kernel Parameter                  Default Value
  --------------------------------  -------------------------------
  ``rd.brltty.braille_driver``      setting in ``/etc/brltty.conf``
  ``rd.brltty.braille_parameters``  setting in ``/etc/brltty.conf``
  ``rd.brltty.braille_device``      setting in ``/etc/brltty.conf``
  ``rd.brltty.text_table``          setting in ``/etc/brltty.conf``
  ``rd.brltty.attributes_table``    setting in ``/etc/brltty.conf``
  ``rd.brltty.contraction_table``   setting in ``/etc/brltty.conf``
  ``rd.brltty.keyboard_table``      setting in ``/etc/brltty.conf``
  ``rd.brltty.log_file``            ``/run/initramfs/brltty.log``
  ``rd.brltty.log_level``           setting in ``/etc/brltty.conf``
  ================================  ===============================

Speech Drivers
--------------

Since speech drivers, by their very nature, require sound:

* None of them can start until the ``initqueue`` hook has been executed.

* None of them can start if sound has been disabled (via the rd.brltty.sound=0
  kernel parameter).

As of the time this was written, here's how well each of the speech drivers
works:

en
  The ``en`` [eSpeak-NG] speech driver works.

es
  The ``es`` [eSpeak] speech driver works. It requires Pulse Audio, so:

  * It doesn't start until the ``initqueue`` hook has been executed.

  * It can't start if Pulse Audio fails to start or has been disabled (via
    the rd.brltty.pulse=0 kernel parameter).

fl
  The ``fl`` [Festival Lite] speech driver doesn't work - it runs but doesn't
  speak. This appears to be due to a bug within Festival Lite itself because
  it also remains silent when tested on the full system.

fv
  The ``fv`` [Festival] speech driver doesn't work - it crashes. This appears
  to be due to a bug within Festival itself because it also crashes when tested
  on the full system.

sd
  The ``sd`` [Speech Dispatcher] speech driver hasn't been tested and probably
  won't work.

What Isn't Supported?
---------------------

Braille device communication via Bluetooth isn't supported because Bluetooth
kernel modules aren't included within the initramfs.

Speech drivers aren't supported because ALSA (sound) kernel modules aren't
included within the initramfs.

Braille accessibility isn't active yet at the ``cmdline`` breakpoint because
it occurs before the ``cmdline`` hook, which is used to start BRLTTY, is
executed.
